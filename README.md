# Budget Monitoring

The Budget Monitoring is a website page created for those who want to track your expenses and compare them with your monthly budget. The Budget Monitoring provides a clear design with high accessibility, and a box to enter their details, like salary, expense value, and expense name. The Budget Monitoring also provides a table with all details inserted before, a balance that changes based on the value of expenses, and a button to delete the expense.

The user will be able to identify any problem with your expenses by checking the table that the Budget Monitoring provides. The user can also see the importance of tracking expenses with the cards located at the bottom of the website.
