# Budget Monitoring

The Budget Monitoring is a website page created for those who want to track your expenses and compare them with your monthly budget. The Budget Monitoring provides a clear design with high accessibility, and a box to enter their details, like salary, expense value, and expense name. The Budget Monitoring also provides a table with all details inserted before, a balance that changes based on the value of expenses, and a button to delete the expense.

The user will be able to identify any problem with your expenses by checking the table that the Budget Monitoring provides. The user can also see the importance of tracking expenses with the cards located at the bottom of the website.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

  > I then received a notification from GitHub that my project is being deployed and after about 1 minute & a couple of refreshes of the page it was ready and live.
